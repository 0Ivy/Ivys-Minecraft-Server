# How To: Making a Faction
So you wish to start a faction, I see? Well, I hope you have it in ya. If you wish to do so, please continue with the following steps.

## Steps:
1. Simply start off by going into the server, and do the `/wilderness` command until you find a nice piece of land you wish to colonize on.
2. Next, simply do the `/f create command`, with your Faction name. `Ex. /f create NobleFaction`
3. Then, from there, you will be able to do the `</f claim>` to claim land towards your faction.
4. Once your faction is made in the server, contact a member of the Minecraft Staff team to receive a discord server template, in which you can use it to make your own discord server for your faction.
5. Once your server is configured to your liking, do the following commands in-game:
* `/f discord` - This command will link your Minecraft account with your discord, through our Factions Manager bot.
* `/f invitebot` - This command will allow you to invite the Factions Manager Bot your discord server.
* `/f setguild <guildID>` - This command links your faction to your discord server. To find the guild(server) ID for your server, follow this guide [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).
6. After you have successfully linked both your faction and faction server together, you can now do the following command in your discord server:
* `.setfchatchannel #global-chat` - This will link in-game faction chat to your discord global chat channel.
* `.setmemberrole @Faction Member` - This will link the member role in both in-game and in discord.
> Side Note: You can do the `.help` command as well to see the other features you can do. I recommend doing the *weewoo* feature, which essentially notifies people in the discord who are offline on the server that the faction is being raided.
7. Once all the configuration is done, follow-up with the staff member (or another staff member if the current one is offline) and notify them that you have successfully created a faction. 
* From there, they will ask you for your faction name and preferred color, which they will use to create a corresponding role in the main discord, for you and your fellow faction people.

Congrats! You have now made your faction!
