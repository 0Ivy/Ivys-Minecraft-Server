# How To: Making & Managing a Faction
So you wish to start a faction, I see? Well, I hope you have it in ya. If you wish to do so, please continue with the following steps.

## Steps:
1. Simply start off by going into the server, and do the `/wilderness` command until you find a nice piece of land you wish to colonize on.
2. Next, simply do the `/f create` command, with your Faction name. `Ex. /f create NobleFaction`
3. Then, from there, you will be able to do the `/f claim` to claim land towards your faction.
> Note: This will only claim a 16x16 block, or 1 chunk, of area, and it will cost 30 of your balance. It will also cost 30 (with a multiplier of 5% each time) to claim new chunks of land.
4. Once your faction is made in the server, contact a member of the Minecraft Staff team to receive a discord server template, in which you can use it to make your own discord server for your faction.
> Note: Read below on how you can configure your server.
5. Once your server is configured to your liking, do the following commands in-game:
* `/f discord` - This command will link your Minecraft account with your discord account, through our Factions Manager bot.
* `/f invitebot` - This command will allow you to invite the Factions Manager Bot your discord server.
* `/f setguild <guildID>` - This command links your faction to your discord server.
> Note: To find the guild(server)ID for your server, follow this guide [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).
6. After you have successfully linked both your faction and faction server together, you can now do the following commands in your discord server, in #bot-management:
* `.setfchatchannel #global-chat` - This will link in-game faction chat to your discord global chat channel.
* `.setmemberrole @Faction Member` - This will link the member role in both in-game and in discord.
> Note: You can do the `.help` command as well to see the other features you can do. I recommend doing the *weewoo* feature, which essentially notifies people in the discord who are offline on the server that the faction is being raided. To read more about this, please read the "Faction Tips & Features" section of this article.
7. Once all the configuration is done, follow-up with the staff member (or another staff member if the current one is offline) and notify them that you have successfully created a faction. 
> Note: From there, they will ask you for your faction name and preferred color, which they will use to create a corresponding role in the main discord, for you and your fellow faction people.

Congrats! You have now made your faction!

> **End Notes**:
> * To invite people into your faction, do `/f invite` command, and the person's name. This will invite them into your faction in-game. Also, on conformation with a staff member of your faction's creation. You will be given the "Faction Leader" role in the main discord, and from there, the perms to role your faction people into your faction.
> * Creating a faction will not be free; it will cost 100 of the balance.
> * You must invite and have a member of the Staff team in your faction's discord server at all times.

## Configuring the Server Template:
So once you receive the Server Template link, please follow these tips/guidelines:

### Server Name and Icon:
* One thing that will be strict on is the name of the discord server. You must name your discord server to the name of your faction.
* The icon/logo is up to you to determine.
### Channel Layout:
* You can edit how the channels are laid out any way you like, just make sure you keep the general idea.
### Roles:
* The roles are pretty standard. If you wish to, you can edit it, but how they are now is sufficient.
* It is preferred though if you keep the "Server Staff" and "Factions Manager" roles are the top of the list.
### Bots:
* You can add any bots you want.
### Receiving Announcement from the Main Discord:
* To set up your server to receive faction announcements from the main discord server, head over to the #faction-announcements channel in the main discord, click the button saying "Follow," then navigate to your server, and allow for faction announcements to be sent to #server-announcements in your discord server.

> **End Notes**:
> * This is entirely optional:
> * But if you wish to have your faction publicly advertised, and have your faction available to join by everyone, please let a Staff Member know.
> * They will follow-up with asking for an invite link to your server, the server icon/logo, and a 2-3 sentence paragraph about your faction.
> * This will be posted in the #faction-info channel in the main discord.
> * As I said, this is completely optional, you don't have to.
> * You can have your faction as invite-only if you want to.
