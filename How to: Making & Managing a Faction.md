# How To: Making a Faction
So you wish to start a faction, I see? Well, I hope you have it in ya. If you wish to do so, please continue with the following steps.

## Steps:
1. Simply start off by going into the server, and do the `/wilderness` command until you find a nice piece of land you wish to colonize on.
2. Next, simply do the `/f create` command, with your Faction name. `Ex. /f create NobleFaction`
3. Then, from there, you will be able to do the `/f claim` to claim land towards your faction.
> Note: this will only claim at 16x16 block, or 1 chunk, of area and it will cost 30 of your balance. It will also cost 30 (with a multiplier of 5% each time) to claim new chunks of land.
4. Once your faction is made in the server, contact a member of the Minecraft Staff team to receive a discord server template, in which you can use it to make your own discord server for your faction.
> Note: Read below on how you can configure your server.
5. Once your server is configured to your liking, do the following commands in-game:
* `/f discord` - This command will link your Minecraft account with your discord account, through our Factions Manager bot.
* `/f invitebot` - This command will allow you to invite the Factions Manager Bot your discord server.
* `/f setguild <guildID>` - This command links your faction to your discord server. To find the guild(server) ID for your server, follow this guide [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).
6. After you have successfully linked both your faction and faction server together, you can now do the following command in your discord server, in #bot-management:
* `.setfchatchannel #global-chat` - This will link in-game faction chat to your discord global chat channel.
* `.setmemberrole @Faction Member` - This will link the member role in both in-game and in discord.
> Note: You can do the `.help` command as well to see the other features you can do. I recommend doing the *weewoo* feature, which essentially notifies people in the discord who are offline on the server that the faction is being raided.
7. Once all the configuration is done, follow-up with the staff member (or another staff member if the current one is offline) and notify them that you have successfully created a faction. 
> Note: From there, they will ask you for your faction name and preferred color, which they will use to create a corresponding role in the main discord, for you and your fellow faction people.

Congrats! You have now made your faction!

> **End Notes**:
> * In order people to be a part of your faction, all you have to do is the `/f invite` command, and the person's name. This is invite them into your faction
> * Creating a faction will not be free, it will have a 100 balance price to it.
> * You must invite and have a member of the Staff team in your faction's discord server at all times.
